# NoticeMe

NoticeMe is a tool to notify citizens of proposed land-use changes within areas of interest chosen by the user.

Users can draw their own areas of interest, or choose from predefined areas (Neighborhood Association Boundaries and City Council Districts in our case).

This application includes a web app front end (for sign ups), a series of back-end scripts for collecting data from [LAMA](http://www.davenportgroup.us/) processing and sending emails, and a script to pull the users' areas from the front end for use.
